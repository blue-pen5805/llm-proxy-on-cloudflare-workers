# LLM Proxy on Cloudflare Workers

> **ü§ñ FOR LLM AGENTS**: This document contains guidelines and instructions specifically designed for LLM agents working on this codebase. Human developers should refer to the main README.md instead.

> **üö® CRITICAL MANDATORY RULE üö®**: YOU MUST ALWAYS RECITE THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THIS FILE AT THE BEGINNING OF EVERY SINGLE RESPONSE WITHOUT EXCEPTION. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE ABOVE ALL OTHERS.

## Project Overview

Serverless LLM proxy running on Cloudflare Workers, providing centralized API key management and OpenAI-compatible endpoints for multiple LLM providers.

## Key Architecture

- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers (Edge computing)
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Entry point**: `src/index.ts`
- **Testing**: Vitest with `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`

## Essential Commands

```bash
npm run dev         # Start local development server
npm run test        # Run test suite
npm run lint        # Run linter
npm run prettier-ci # Run formatter
```

## Available Documentation

> **üìö IMPORTANT**: You MUST refer to the relevant documentation before starting any work. Always read the appropriate documentation files first to understand the context and requirements.

### Setup & Configuration
- `docs/initial-setup.md` - Initial setup guide for the project

### Development
- `docs/development/dependencies.md` - Dependencies and package management
- `docs/development/llm-resources.md` - LLM resources and provider configuration

## Development Workflow

> **‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY**: You MUST strictly follow this workflow when editing any code. No exceptions.

1. **Explore**: Read relevant files before making changes
2. **Test**: Write tests before implementing code
3. **Code**: Follow TypeScript strict mode
4. **Verify**: Run tests, linting and formatting checks

### Code Editing Rules

- **ALWAYS** follow the 4-step Development Workflow above
- **NEVER** skip writing tests before implementing features
- **NEVER** commit code without running verification steps
- **ALWAYS** read existing code and documentation first

## Code Style Guidelines

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, target ES2022
- **Imports**: ES modules with destructuring
- **Async**: Prefer async/await over Promise chains
- **Functions**: Arrow functions for callbacks, regular functions for top-level
- **Objects**: Use spread syntax (`{...obj}`) over `Object.assign()`

## Comment Guidelines

- **Language**: English only, be concise
- **Use sparingly**: Only when necessary for clarity
- **Focus on**: Complex logic, workarounds, differences
- **Avoid**: Self-explanatory code, type info (TypeScript handles this)

## Documentation Guidelines

- **Format**: Markdown files in `docs/`
- **Language**: English for main documentation, Japanese translations with `_ja.md` suffix (both languages required)
- **Structure**: Use headings, bullet points, code blocks
- **Simplicity**: Keep it clear and concise
- **Examples**: Include code snippets for complex concepts
